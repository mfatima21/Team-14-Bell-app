Who are we?
- Women quota of 50%
- Background: students, security engineer, research....
- Techstacks of each person

Summary of problem statement
- Open the fridge and have no clue what to do because it is "empty" -> leads to food waste
- Foodwaste leads to unnecessary CO2-emissions, biodiversity loss and land and water consumption. 
- According to a study at ETHZ 25 per cent of the environmental impact of our food system is due to food waste: https://www.bafu.admin.ch/bafu/en/home/topics/waste/guide-to-waste-a-z/biodegradable-waste/types-of-waste/lebensmittelabfaelle.html
- Fighting food waste is in line with Sustainable Development Goal 12.3 of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development: https://www.undp.org/sustainable-development-goals
- Our solution tackles the problem at the root: provides a way to scan the fridge contents and get recipe suggestions from the products inside

Tech Stack:
 - VueJS 2
 - Vuetify
 - API to XYZ to send the picture and get the ingredients
 - API to ABC to send products and get back recipes
 - ....

 Functions

 - Scan fridge -> enrich data with Bell products with self written algorithm -> get recipe suggestions

 Challenges & Learnings
 - Finding tech stack -> tinker and hack
 - Finding API: table spoon as ingredient
 - ...
